# Dealing with Javascript

![FOR BEGINNERS!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89994686/220136027-196c8e77-1c2e-4f39-a9cd-44e86acf9c11.png)

Javascript is the language of the web. JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. This open source project was started as an accident, originally made for my threads and code snippets, but I with some other contributors are looking forward to make this project huge, especially for beginners in Javascript.

We will be making continuous improvements to the repository, there will be different modules covering various aspects of Javascript and with the mission to teach you in a simple and easy way!

Many changes and amazing updates coming soon, stay tuned :)

### Tips for beginners

1. Do not rush through the concepts.
2. Start implementing as soon as you can.
3. Consider this as a guide instead of learning the concepts!
4. You can find these concepts all over the internet but I have tried to explain it in the easiest way possible.

## Installation

Use VS Code IDE for editing and install live server extension.
You can install the following extensions for an amazing coding experience:
    1. Live Server
    2. HTML CSS Support
    3. Javascript Snippets
    4. JS Debugger
    5. Babel intellisense
