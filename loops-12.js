// Let's learn about Loops in Javascript and why they are used?

// Sample loop (print 1 to 10):

for(let i=1; i<=10; i++)
{
    console.log(i + " "); // logs 1 to 10.
}

/* Why do we need Loops?

-> Wanting to run a sequence of code over and over can become lengthy.
-> We can specify certain conditions and run a loop to print, or execute a statement.
-> Loops are very important as a concept, even in DSA loops are used often.
